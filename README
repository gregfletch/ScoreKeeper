Game ScoreKeeper
================

Do you enjoy playing card games or board games that require you to keep
score (such as Scrabble, Quiddler, Munchkin, Rummy, etc.), but hate
doing all that complicated math after each turn?  Then this app is for
you!

To begin, add the players who will be playing and when it comes time
to update a player's score, simply click the edit button in the Action
Bar and enter the number of points to add (negative number will subtract
that number of points).  Your Android device takes care of all that tricky
math.  As a bonus, share the scoreboard with the other players using
NFC and Android Beam!

This app is only supported on phones and tablets running Ice Cream Sandwich
(Android 4.0) or newer in order to support the NFC functionality.

This is an open source project released under the GPL.  Source code is
available at https://github.com/gregfletch/ScoreKeeper.  Issues are
tracked at https://github.com/gregfletch/ScoreKeeper/issues.  Bug reports
and code contributions are welcome!
